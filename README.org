* MAS
Due to lack of a better clue on naming for this project I have decided to name it as if it were about multiagent systems, which, in part, it is

It is mostly implmenetations (and visualizations) for various algorithms involving a bunch of separate particles moving about

* Structure of this repo
as of writing
- ~rayed-bqn~ is a submodule and go read its docs if you wanna know what it is
- ~mas~ is the directory where I put my various implementations for things

* Currently implemented mas
- ~template.bqn~ not a mas, just an example from rayed-bqn that I have shoved in the mas directory as an easy means to have a minimal working example for a rayed-bqn program
- ~rendezvouz.bqn~ a (questionalbe) implementation of a rendezvouz for agents with a single integrator dynamic using an (equally questionalbe implementation of) artificial potential fields.
- ~boids.bqn~ boids

* To be implemented
(nothing here currently)
